                            <p>When building an e-commerce website there are
                                many factors that you have to consider in order
                                to be successful. One factor that is vital to
                                ensure that customers return and feel safe using
                                your website, is security. Many people are aware
                                of the potential risks when it comes to online
                                shopping, and if a customer does not feel that
                                the payment process is secure, they might
                                abandon their shopping carts and look elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>E-commerce security focuses on safe and secure
                                electronic transactions and keeping all stored
                                data protected against cyber-attacks, which can
                                be sold on the dark web and used for identity
                                theft. These attacks can seriously harm your
                                online stores' reputation; therefore, it is
                                vital to understand what the most common
                                e-commerce security threats are, and how to
                                prevent them from destroying your online
                                business. </p>
                            <p>Firstly, one of the most common threats to be
                                aware of is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which
                                involves an attacker inserting a malicious piece
                                of code, usually in JavaScript, onto your
                                website. The browser sees it as regular script
                                and executes it. This script can give the hacker
                                access to confidential data such as credit card
                                information and exposes the victim to phishing
                                attacks and malware installations. </p>
                            <p>Secondly, SQL Injectionâ€™s, which can affect any
                                site that uses an SQL database. The hacker can
                                insert an SQL query into the database which
                                would look like legitimate SQL. Once processed
                                the hacker can gain access to the database, view
                                sensitive information and even create an admin
                                account so they can gain full access to the
                                system via the backend. </p>
                            <p>Another common threat is Malware, which is
                                harmful software to a website, server and
                                network and can take shape within the form of
                                viruses, trojans and worms. Malware is used for
                                controlling computers, forming a botnet as part
                                of a DDoS attack to steal information and
                                perform spam activities. </p>
                            <p>To prevent attacks and data breaches on your
                                website, there are a few security measures your
                                website should follow. Using ready to use
                                payment platforms that are secure and well
                                known, like PayPal or Stripe. Using these
                                platforms will give the customer a choice of
                                multiple methods and they can choose whichever
                                makes them feel more secure. </p>
                            <p>Additionally, you should make sure your website
                                is set up with an SSL certificate, and it is
                                running over HTTPS. An SSL certificate ensures
                                that your website is encrypted, and all user
                                data is secure from hackers if intercepted
                                through the internet. If you do not have an SSL
                                installed, the browsers will warn users that the
                                website is not secure, and it can also affect
                                SEO Rankings. </p>
                            <p>Many other factors should be addressed to keep
                                your website secure, failing to do so will
                                impact your business and customers data. </p>
